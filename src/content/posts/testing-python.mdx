## Why?

Though I've become accustomed to writing bash scripts to automate the testing of my command&ndash;line applications, upon being introduced to Ruby testing while reading Michael Hartl&rsquo;s [The Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book), I was surprised by how much easier debugging is when you&rsquo;re able to write tests for each component of the program, rather than just the input/output of my bash scripts. So given my proclivity for Python, I instantly became curious about the process of implementing similar tests in Python.  

## Okay, How?  

After a bit of research into the available testing frameworks, I decided on [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) due to the balance of capability and ease&ndash;of&ndash;use. Additionally, we&rsquo;ll be writing a few tests for my [yt2mp3](https://github.com/tterb/yt2mp3) program, which I had previously been testing using one of the aforementioned bash scripts.  

## Setup  
Before we start writing tests, we need to create a new file with the following convention, `test_{filename}.py`. This is so that [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) can accurately identify the files that contain tests to execute, when we run from the command&ndash;line, as shown below:
```bash
$ pytest
```
<p className='h-tip'>I prefer running pytest with the `-v` or `--verbose` flag, as this prints the test that is being run and whether it passed/failed.</p>


## Basic Testing  

To get started, the first test we&rsquo;re going to write is going to ensure that the program is able to accurately retrieve the title of a YouTube video when given a URL.  

For this we&rsquo;re going to:  
  * Get the URL for a YouTube video with a known title
  * provide the URL to the yt2mp3.getVideoTitle() function
  * Check that the function returns the expected video title

```python
import os, pytest, yt2mp3
# We're not using 'os' in this test but we will later

def test_video_title():
    url = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0DPdy98e4c'
    title = yt2mp3.getVideoTitle(url)
    assert title == 'TEST VIDEO'
```

You&rsquo;ll notice that the only difference in this function is that pytest uses an `assert`&ndash;statement where you might usually expect a `return`&ndash;statement.  

Similarly, we can also write a test to check that the `yt2mp3.getVideoList()` function successfully retrieves the URLs for each video in the provided playlist. For this test, I&rsquo;ve created a simple test playlist that features three videos to keep the number of URLs manageable and prevent modifications from changing the expected result.  

So we need to:  
  * Provide the URL for our test playlist
  * Provide a list of the URLs for each video in the playlist
  * Check that the function returns a list that matches the defined list

```python
def test_get_playlist():
    url = 'https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGqB3S8f_uiLkCQziivGYI3zNtLJvfUWm'
    video_list = [
          'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FrOQC-zEog',
          'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvPr9YV7-Xw',
          'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EzURpTF5c8'
    ]
    playlist = yt2mp3.getVideoList(url)
    assert playlist == video_list
```

## Using Fixtures  

To introduce the idea of fixtures, we&rsquo;ll write a test that requires that we have a `Song` object, which stores the data necessary for downloading and setting the ID3 tags of the output mp3 file. Therefore, it&rsquo;s understandable that a similar `Song` object may be necessary to test multiple functionalities of the program. That&rsquo;s where fixtures come in.  

```python
@pytest.fixture
def test_song():
    data = yt2mp3.getSongData('Bold as Love', 'Jimi Hendrix')
    data['video_url'] = yt2mp3.getVideoURL(data['track_name'], data['artist_name'])
    yt2mp3.Song(data)
```

While, you can see that there&rsquo;s not a lot of code that goes into creating the object, it&rsquo;s best to follow the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principal and avoid redundancy.  
Now that our fixture is defined, we are going to use it to write two tests to check the program&rsquo;s ability to download a video and convert the video to an mp3.  
To test the program&rsquo;s download functionality, we&rsquo;ll utilize the fact that the `yt2mp3.download()` function returns the filepath when the download is successful by asserting that the returned filepath exists.  
<p className='h-note'>Notice that we&rsquo;ve provided our `test_song` fixture as a parameter of the test function.</p>

```python
def test_video_download(test_song):
    video_path = yt2mp3.download(test_song.video_url)
    assert os.path.exists(video_path)
```

Once the program passes the above test, we now know that we have a video in the `~/Downloads/Music/temp/` directory that we can use to test the program's conversion to mp3. Additionally, since the `yt2mp3.convertToMP3()` function also returns the output filepath we are able to use a similar method for validation as we saw in the previous test, by checking the existance of the output path.  

```python
def test_convert_mp3(test_song):
    temp_dir = os.path.expanduser('~/Downloads/Music/temp/')
    video_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, os.listdir(temp_dir)[0])
    song_path = yt2mp3.convertToMP3(video_path, test_song)
    assert os.path.exists(song_path)
```

Though, the `yt2mp3.convertToMP3()` is also responsible for deleting the converted video file after the conversion. Luckily, we&rsquo;re also able to validate this process within the same test by adding another condition and a bit of additional logging.

```python
def test_convert_mp3(test_song):
    errors = []
    temp_dir = os.path.expanduser('~/Downloads/Music/temp/')
    video_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, os.listdir(temp_dir)[0])
    song_path = yt2mp3.convertToMP3(video_path, test_song)
    # highlight-start
    if os.path.exists(video_path):
        errors.append('The video file wasn\'t deleted after conversion')
    # highlight-end
    if not os.path.exists(song_path):
        errors.append('The output MP3 file doesn\'t exist')
    assert not errors, 'errors occured:\n{}'.format('\n'.join(errors))
```

## Conclusion  

Now we already have tests that cover a significant amount of the programs processes, without requiring a whole lot of work(*or code*). 
Hopefully, these examples have provided you a launchpad for testing your own python programs. Though I expect that I&rsquo;ll be updating this post or posting a follow&ndash;up with more helpful info as I become increasingly versed in Python testing.
