As a long-time Sublime Text user, I&rsquo;ve recently made the transition to using <img className='inline' src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16360374/41584818-231060ca-735d-11e8-90e3-d7ad66a20f85.png' width='20' alt='atom' /> [Atom](https://atom.io/) as my go&ndash;to code editor after falling in love with it&rsquo;s package selection and &ldquo;*hackable*&rdquo; nature. I also know from experience that changes like these can be a little bewildering, so I thought others might benefit from a simple resource to started configuring their Atomic workspace.

## Installing packages

All of the featured packages are published through [apm](https://github.com/atom/apm) and can be installed via the following command:

## Just for Fun
  * [**Activate Power Mode**](https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode) &#8211; a fun package which adds a little bit more excitement to writing code. Although
  personally, I found the constant animations and shaking to be a little disorienting, so I chose to disabled that package and instead
  replaced it with [Activate Power Mode Delete](https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode-delete).
