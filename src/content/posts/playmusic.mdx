  <img src='https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16360374/23335412/21511926-fb6a-11e6-8bb5-249567ecd85a.png' height='240' alt='variants' title='Variants'/>
</p>
<h3 className='text-center'>Variants</h3>
<p className='text-center'>
  PlayMusic features square, round, and landscape variants, which in conjunction with its added scalability settings, guarantee its ability to compliment any desktop layout.
</p>

<h3 className='text-center'>Settings</h3>
<p className='text-center'>
  In order to facilitate easy customization, PlayMusic includes a highly intuitive settings menu, making configuration and modification a breeze. This menu will be launched upon installation, though it can also be accessed at any time by pressing the  <img className='inline-flex bg-opacity-80 max-w-4 h-4 mx-1' src='https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16360374/21559428/fe6a3654-ce00-11e6-8d2c-ba8570e3132c.png' height='12' alt='icon'/>  on any of the skin variants.
</p>

<h3 className='text-center'>Accent Colors</h3>
<p className='text-center'>
  The addition of selectable accent colors allows users to add a splash of color to their skin, while also allowing PlayMusic to tastefully adapt to any theme, layout, or wallpaper.
</p>

<h3 className='text-center'>Visualizer</h3>
<p className='text-center'>
  In addition to providing added functionality to the skin, the recent adoption of a highly customizable visualizer also allows one more way of making this skin your own.
</p>

<h3 className='text-center'>Minimization</h3>
<p className='text-center'>
  By default, the skin displays a <img className='inline-flex bg-opacity-80 max-w-8 h-6 mx-1' src='https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16360374/22850002/fb77e47c-efb7-11e6-9199-b6b027504656.png' height='23' alt='icon'/>  icon whenever GPMDP is inactive, conserving useful desktop space, while also serving as a convenient launcher for the application. Though this functionality, as well as the displayed icon can be modified or disabled in the settings menu.
</p>

<h3 className='text-center'>Volume Control</h3>
<p align='text-center'>
  This skin also features the ability to easily adjust your computers volume by simply scrolling up or down on the mouse-wheel with your cursor over the skin.
</p>

-------------------------------------------------------  

## Setup

  This skin requires you have **[Google Play Music Desktop Player]** installed to function properly.
  After installation, you must also enable *Playback API* in GPMDP&rsquo;s Desktop Settings, shown in the image below, as this allows GPMDP to interface with external applications.

  <p className='text-center'>
