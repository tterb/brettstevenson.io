## Description  
The goal of this plugin is to allow users to bring their content to life and cultivate engaged communities by integrating [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments into their blazing-fast [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) websites. After struggling to integrate a few different Disqus React components into my Gatsby site, creating an easily-configurable plugin for the Gatsby ecosystem felt like a no-brainer.  

## Install  
```bash
$ yarn add gatsby-plugin-disqus
```  
or  
```bash
$ npm install -S gatsby-plugin-disqus
```

## Configure  

Add the plugin to your `gatsby-config.js` file with your [Disqus shortname](https://help.disqus.com/installation/whats-a-shortname)  

```jsx
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-disqus`,
      options: {
        shortname: `your-disqus-shortname`
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

## Usage  

The plugin can be used as shown in this brief example:  

```jsx
import Disqus from 'gatsby-plugin-disqus'

const PostTemplate = () => (
  <>
    /* Page Contents */
    <Disqus 
      identifier={post.id}
      title={post.title}
      url={`${config.siteUrl}${location.pathname}`}
    />
  </>
)

export default PostTemplate
```

While providing an `identifier`, `title`, and `url` are optional, it is recommended as it will ensure that threads won't be lost in the case that the domain changes or the post is renamed.
