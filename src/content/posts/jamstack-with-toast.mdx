For a bit of context, my introduction to the JAMstack came by way of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub Pages, though I found myself devising overly-complicated Gulpfiles in an effort to optimize my sites performance. As a result, I started to explore my options.
I shortly became interested in the performance focus and baked-in optimizations of [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and decided to transition my personal website to using GatsbyJS and Netlify. I was so impressed by GatsbyJS that I became a contributer and published a plugin.

Now, while I still appreciate many of aspects of Gatsby and the surrounding ecosystem, I've recently found myself frustrated by abstract webpack errors and increasingly cumbersome build-times.

So I was immediately intrigued when I heard Chris Biscardi sharing his same frustrations with a potential solution during his [Jamstack Lightning Launch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2C0SIJFlv8) at the Jamstack Conf 2021. Throughout the presentation he went on to describe the philosophy, performance, and tools he was using to build [Toast](https://github.com/toastdotdev/toast).
