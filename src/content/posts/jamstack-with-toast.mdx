For a bit of context, my introduction to the JAMstack initially came by way of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and GitHub Pages. Though, I found myself devising overly-complicated Gulpfiles in an effort to optimize my sites performance. As a result, I decided to start exploring my options.
With that in mind, it should be no surprise that I was immediately attracted to [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) after learning about the performance focus and baked-in optimizations. From there, I decided to rewrite my personal website using Gatsby and was so impressed that I became a contributor and published a plugin.
Fast forward a couple years, and while I still appreciate many aspects of Gatsby and the surrounding ecosystem, I often find myself frustrated by abstract webpack errors and increasingly cumbersome build-times.
This has had me thinking, is there a better way?

Though, after looking into some alternative solutions, I wasn't able to find anything that could really grab my attention until attending Chris Biscardi's [Jamstack Lightning Launch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2C0SIJFlv8) at the Jamstack Conf 2021.
Throughout the presentation, Chris shared similar frustrations with the existing SSG landscape and described the philosophy, performance, and motivation for building [Toast](https://github.com/toastdotdev/toast).
